A C++11-based (and above) library for developing ONVIF protocol
# Introduction
This is my first open-source project. I don't know how the final result will be, so let's give it a try and work hard
# Development environment
Ubuntu system, C++11 and above standards, if other Linux systems, you can try yourself, if there are problems, you can also contact meã€‚
For now, to make things easier, we are temporarily considering using the WSL-Ubuntu system for development.
